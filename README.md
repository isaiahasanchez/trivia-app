## Technical Overview

1. **Trivia Game Mechanics**: Users can fetch new trivia questions, display potential answers, and reveal the correct answer. Score tracking is implemented for two teams.
2. **API Integration**: Fetches trivia questions dynamically from an external API, which provides a variety of categories and difficulty levels.
3. **CSS Styling**: Simple and clean styles applied using vanilla CSS, ensuring the user experience is straightforward and intuitive.
4. **Interactive Elements**: DOM manipulations in JavaScript allow for dynamic user interactions, such as revealing answers or selecting trivia categories.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the app, with placeholders for dynamic content and controls for user interactions.
- `main.js`: Houses the core logic for the Trivia Game, including fetching questions, displaying them, managing scores, and handling user interactions.
- `style.css`: Provides styling for the application, ensuring a clear and responsive user experience.
